    "header3": "How does this Website work?",
    "paragraph3.1": "As soon as you enter the Website, a Cookie with the key 'lang' is set in your browser. This Cookie is responsible for defining which language the Website will be configured in.",
    "paragraph3.2": "The possible values for this Cookie are: (en, pt), which correspond to English and Portuguese respectively.",
    "paragraph3.3": "If the Cookie assumes an invalid value, the system will automatically set the Cookie value to the default Website language, which I defined as English.",

    "header4": "Why did I develop this Website?",
    "paragraph4.1": "Having the technology to change your Website language natively is extremely important nowadays. A Website that can adapt to the user conveys greater professionalism, care, and seriousness toward the client. Motivated by this, I started studying different techniques developers use to implement this feature in their systems. That is how I arrived at this conclusion: a system that manages the Website language through the user's browser cookies.",

    "header5": "Where can I find the source code for this system?",
    "paragraph5.1": "You can find it on my GitHub. And if you have any questions about this system, just contact me through my LinkedIn. 😉"
